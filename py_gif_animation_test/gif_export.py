This is a helper for the Processing gifAnimation library https://github.com/extrapixel/gif-animation/tree/3.0
Download the library from github.com/extrapixel/gif-animation/archive/3.0.zip 
Unzip and copy the gifAnimation folder into your libraries folder, like shown below:
user/sketchbook/libraries/gifAnimation (Linux) 
user/Documents/Processing/libraries/gifAnimation (Mac/Windows) 

# This file should be saved as a 'tab' named gif_export.py in your Processing Python Mode sketch
# Restart the IDE and add these lines at the start of your sketch:
add_library('gifAnimation')
from gif_export import gif_export

# then add this at the end of draw():
gif_export(GifMaker, "filename")
